Trying to look into solving the fourier transform

## p1.py: 
simple sin wave as in [wiki-animation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Fourier_series_square_wave_circles_animation.gif) - only the first file

<!---
in memory of p2.py
-->

## p3.py:
approximation of square wave can be improved by increasing the number n as in the [linked animation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Fourier_series_square_wave_circles_animation.gif)
as [sample](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11qcHuTTWHL-v26pPUP74XNj3lrsXJoov)

## p4.py: 
* trying to judge the [Fourier transform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) for a given series in the specified detail , that is, 
* given a function f(x):  
* trying to find the coefficient of g(x) that approximates f(x) = only anti-clockwise rotation of the involved circles

## p5.py:
* same as p4 but covers clockwise rotation also
* [click-here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kL9WYyZyflGb1526HtNgoauKkkag60YK) for tanx
